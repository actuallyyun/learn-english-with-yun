          <p> So that's it? I just have to change to a different mindset? </p>
          <p>I wish it was that easy. The hard truth is that learning a language, any languge, is hard. Learning is hard and painful, and it is supposed to. 
            That's also why we love it.</p>
          <p>But for learning to happen, first you need to have the right mindset.</p>

          <p>Learning a languge needs <span className='text-red-400'>A LOT OF </span>practie.</p>
          <p>However, not all practice is created equal. To optimize learning, we need to be alert, focused, and aware of what we are learning. </p>
          <p>What does this mean? Have your tried to learn English by watching TV series but never felt that you have made progress? Well your learning pratice is perhaps not mindful enough.</p>

          <p className='pt-3'> <span className='bg-red-200 text-2xl p-3'>Consistency</span></p>

          <p>Never mind the 10,000 hours law. Getting better at anything takes a long time, let alone a complex skill such as acquiring a new language.</p>

          <p>Learning English needs to be a part of your life.</p>
          <p>You are not going to get noticeablely better next week, even the next month. But if you learn consistently, you will see progress. </p>


          <p className='pt-3'> <span className='text-3xl'>There has to be a better way</span></p>


          <p>Time to try something new. </p>
          <p>To quote Einstein, <span className='italic bg-green-400'>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.</span></p>
          <p>If what you have tried has not worked, you might want to try a different method.So often when we feel that we can't learn, the problem lies in the method.</p>
          <p>Maybe it is not the right one for you.</p>
          <p>I understand that it could be overwhelming trying to find solution on your own. <span className='font-bold'>And you don't have time for another failed attempt.</span> </p>
